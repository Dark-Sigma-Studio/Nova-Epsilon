# NOTES
	the player races will be seperate classes, and such will all inherit from "Race".
	Each race will need to handle internal situations in a unique way, and will likely need to pass information between other classes as well in order to work properly.
	The synth race will need to have access to when the player is jumping and when the player is moving in order to drain the battery.
	Most races will have their own set of prefabs that they all govern, including but not limited to the UI used for each race.
